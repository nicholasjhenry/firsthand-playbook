From "Java Modeling in Color with UML" pg 41:

Where to put a method? Take a feature statement, `<action>` the `<result>` `<by|for|of|to>` a `<moment-interval|role|description|part, place, thing>`. Put the initiating method in the corresponding class.

Here we want to "calculate the anticipated total of an RFQ." So we put the initiating method in the RFQ class.
